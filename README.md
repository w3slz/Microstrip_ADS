# Wideband Matching Network in Microstrip Technology

## Description
Design wideband matching network microstrip to meet band edge VSWR, FBW, and center frequency specifications using substrate with given properties.

## Procedure
1)	Create initial design on paper using equations
2)	Model and perform simulation of design in ADS
3)	Adjust design and re-simulate until specifications are met
